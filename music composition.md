# MuseGAN

[MuseGAN](https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/) is a project on music generation. In essence, we aim to generate polyphonic music of multiple tracks(instruments) with harmonic and rhythmic structure, multi-tracks
 interdependency and temporal structure. To our knowledge, our work represents the first approach that deal with these issues altogether.

 The models are trained with [Lakh Pianoroll Dataset](https://salu133445.github.io/musegan.io/musegan/date) dataset, in an unsupervised approach.The proposed models are able to generate music either from scratch,
 or by accompanying a track given by user.
 Specifically, we use the model to generate pop song phrases consisting of bass, drums, guitar, piano and strings tracks.

 Sample results are available

 ## BinaryMuseGAN
 [BinaryMuseGAN] is a follow up project.

 In this project, we first investigate how the real-valued piano-rolls generated by the generator may lead to difficulties in training the discriminator for CNN-based models.

 To overcome the binarization issue, we propose to append to the generator an additional refiner network, which try to refine the real-valued predictions generated by the pretrained generator to binary-valued ones.
 The proposed model is able to directly generate binary-valued piano-rolls at test time.
