# Audio Editing

LosslessCut aims to be the ultimate cross platform FFmpeg GUI for extremely fast and lossless operations on video, audio, subtitle and other related media files.
The main feature is lossless trimming and cutting of video and audio files, which is great for saving space by rough-cutting your large video files taken from a video camera, GoPro, drone, etc.It lets you quickly
extract the good parts from your videos and discard many gigabytes of date without doing a slow re-encode and thereby losing quality. Or you can add a music or subtitle track to your video without needing to 
encode.Everything is extremely fase because it does an almost direct data copy, fueled by awesome FFmpeg which does all the grunt work.

## Features
- Lossless cutting of most video and audio formats
